Overview
--------
This package contains a set of nagios checks useful for monitoring a
RabbitMQ server. They use the RabbitMQ management interface over HTTP
and therefore have a very light profile on the monitoring server of your choice(Nagios, Icinga2, etc.).

See the [documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) on the
RabbitMQ management interface for more details on what it provides.

Branches
--------
- **master** - Default and development branch which use ``Monitoring::plugin`` . All pull request are merged on this branch and tested before any merging or backporting to other branches


NOTE: The perl Nagios::plugin is now deprecated and renamed into Monitoring::plugin. It's explained [here](http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/Nagios-Plugin-0.990001/lib/Nagios/Plugin.pm).
> Nagios::Plugin - Removed from CPAN by request of Nagios Enterprises, succeeded by Monitoring::Plugin

Status
------
Currently we have the following checks:

- check\_rabbitmq\_aliveness
  - Use the `/api/aliveness-test` API to send/receive a message.

- check\_rabbitmq\_connections
  - Use the `/api/connections` API to gather details of connections used,
    their state and their throughput

- check\_rabbitmq\_exchange
  - Use the `/api/exchanges` API to collect average rates of confirmed, published in and published out
    messages/second in a period of time on a given exchange.

- check\_rabbitmq\_objects
  - Use a variety of APIs to count instances of various objects on the
    server. These include vhosts, exchanges, bindings, queues and
    channels.

- check\_rabbitmq\_overview
  - Use the `/api/overview` API to collect the number of pending, ready
    and unacknowledged messages on the server

- check\_rabbitmq\_partition
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to check for partitions in a RabbitMQ cluster.

- check\_rabbitmq\_cluster
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to check how many node are alive in the cluster.

- check\_rabbitmq\_queue
  - Use the `/api/queue` API to collect the number of pending, ready and
    unacknowledged messages and the number of consumers on a given queue or
    all the queues available. Exclude parameter also works if all queues
    are checked

- check\_rabbitmq\_server
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to gather resource usage of the rabbitmq server
    node

- check\_rabbitmq\_shovels
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API check that all the shovels of the given RabbitMQ
    host are running

- check\_rabbitmq\_watermark
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to check to see if mem_alarm has been set to true

See the relevant POD documentation/man pages for more information on usage.
